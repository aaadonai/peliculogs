# Epilogue for Micro.blog

Epilogue is a companion app for Micro.blog. It uses Micro.blog's bookshelves to help you track what books you are reading or want to read. You can blog about a book directly from Epilogue.

The app UI is built using HTML, with a lightweight native Swift wrapper. JavaScript is used to access the Micro.blog API. The goal is to share almost everything between iOS and Android. In the future, we may replace some of the interface with more native code where it makes sense to improve the user experience.
