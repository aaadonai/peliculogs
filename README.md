# Epilogue for Micro.blog

Epilogue is a companion app for Micro.blog. It uses Micro.blog's bookshelves to help you track what books you are reading or want to read. You can blog about a book directly from Epilogue.

**Note:** The app is being rewritten using React Native. For the stable, shipping version of the app, checkout the tag `release/ios/1.0.1`.
