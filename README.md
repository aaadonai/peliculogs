# Peliculogs for Micro.blog

This is a fork of [Epilogue](https://github.com/microdotblog/epilogue) a companion app for [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) and adapted for movies. It keeps an in-app watchlist to help you track what movies and tv shows you are watching or want to watch. You can blog about a movie directly from peliculogs. 

Peliculogs is a play with the words Peliculas (Spanish for movies) and Blogs.

As of 12/29/2024 this is just a fork no code changes yet.
